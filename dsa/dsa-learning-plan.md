# DSA Learning Plan - Your Personal Tutorial

## Overview: 6-Day Progressive Learning Path

This plan is designed to take you from fundamentals to interview-ready in 6 days. Each day builds on previous concepts with increasing complexity.

### Learning Philosophy
- **Understand, don't memorize** - Learn the "why" behind each approach
- **Pattern recognition** - Most problems follow common patterns
- **Progressive complexity** - Start easy, build confidence, increase difficulty
- **Active learning** - Solve on your own first, then check solution
- **Interview mindset** - Think aloud, discuss trade-offs, consider edge cases

### Daily Structure (2-3 hours per day)
1. **Concept Learning** (30 min) - Understand the pattern/technique
2. **Guided Practice** (60 min) - Solve with detailed explanations
3. **Independent Practice** (30-60 min) - Try on your own
4. **Review & Reflection** (15 min) - What did you learn?

## How to Use This Plan

### For Each Problem:

**Step 1: Read the Problem** (2 min)
- Understand requirements
- Identify inputs and expected outputs
- Think about edge cases

**Step 2: Think First** (5 min)
- Don't code immediately!
- Think about approach
- Consider brute force first
- Then think of optimizations

**Step 3: Read "How to Think About This"** (3 min)
- Understand the pattern
- Learn the technique
- See the intuition

**Step 4: Try to Solve** (15-20 min)
- Code your solution
- Test with examples
- Don't peek at solution!

**Step 5: Compare Solutions** (10 min)
- Compare your approach with provided solution
- Understand differences
- Learn optimization techniques

**Step 6: Analyze Complexity** (5 min)
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Trade-offs

---

## Success Metrics

By end of Day 6, you should be able to:
- ✅ Recognize common problem patterns immediately
- ✅ Explain your approach clearly before coding
- ✅ Write clean, working code in 20-30 minutes
- ✅ Analyze time and space complexity
- ✅ Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches
- ✅ Handle edge cases systematically

## Interview Tips Integration

Throughout this plan, I'll teach you:
- How to communicate your thought process
- How to start with brute force, then optimize
- How to test your code systematically
- How to handle hints from interviewer
- How to recover from mistakes
