## Key Features

### Iterative System Design Approach
Unlike traditional system design resources, this repo uses an **iterative interview approach**:
- Start with bare minimum (10 lines of code)
- Add complexity step-by-step (10 iterations)
- Discuss tradeoffs at each step
- Show production evolution (cost, scale, monitoring)

**Example**: Agentic AI system goes from:
- Iteration 1: Single LLM ($5/query)
- → Iteration 7: Model routing + caching ($0.0022/query)
- 2,272x cost reduction with detailed reasoning at each step!

### Code + Theory
- Not just theory - working code for everything
- Jupyter notebooks with runnable examples
- Production-ready patterns and architectures
- Real-world tradeoffs and cost calculations

### 2025 Interview Standards
- Based on latest industry practices (2025)
- MLCommons ARES evaluation standards
- Anthropic, LangGraph, CrewAI best practices
- Production metrics (cost, latency, accuracy)
