# Python OOP Masterclass - Project Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive learning resource for Python Object-Oriented Programming, covering everything from zero to architect level. The content is designed to prepare developers for senior staff engineer positions at companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon.

## Content Guidelines

### Teaching Style
- Start with fundamentals and build progressively
- Include extensive examples with explanations
- Use real-world scenarios and use cases
- Provide step-by-step breakdowns of complex concepts
- Include "Why" and "When to use" sections
- Add common pitfalls and best practices

### Documentation Standards
- Follow Google Python Style Guide
- Include type hints in all code examples
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Include error handling examples
- Show both basic and advanced usage patterns

### Visual Aids
- Use Mermaid diagrams extensively for:
  - Class hierarchies and relationships
  - Sequence diagrams for interactions
  - Flowcharts for decision processes
  - Architecture diagrams
  - State diagrams where applicable

### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8
- Use modern Python features (3.10+)
- Include async/await examples where relevant
- Demonstrate proper error handling
- Show production-ready code patterns
- Include logging and debugging examples

### Coverage Areas
1. Foundational OOP (classes, objects, methods)
2. Core OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)
3. Advanced OOP (metaclasses, descriptors, protocols, ABC)
4. Modern Python features (dataclasses, type hints, async)
5. Pydantic for validation
6. All 23 Gang of Four design patterns
7. SOLID principles
8. Clean architecture patterns
9. Backend engineering patterns
10. Testing strategies and patterns
11. Performance optimization
12. Production-ready patterns

### Document Structure
Each document should include:
- Clear learning objectives
- Theory with visual diagrams
- Progressive code examples (simple to complex)
- Real-world use cases
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Interview questions
- Practice exercises
- References and further reading

## Target Audience
Developers aiming for senior staff engineer roles at FAANG companies, with content suitable for:
- Beginners starting with Python OOP
- Intermediate developers deepening their understanding
- Advanced developers learning architectural patterns
- Backend engineers building production systems
