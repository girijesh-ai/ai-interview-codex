> A complete resource covering agentic AI patterns, frameworks, and best practices for building production-ready AI agent systems.

## Overview

This collection provides comprehensive coverage of **agentic AI** - the next evolution of LLM applications where AI systems can plan, reason, use tools, and autonomously accomplish complex tasks. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, building production systems, or exploring cutting-edge AI architectures, this guide has you covered.

### What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to LLM-powered systems that can:
- üéØ **Plan** - Decompose complex tasks into steps
- ü§î **Reason** - Think through problems using Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts
- üîß **Use Tools** - Call APIs, search databases, execute code
- üîÑ **Iterate** - Refine outputs based on feedback
- ü§ù **Collaborate** - Work with other agents or humans
- üìä **Learn** - Adapt based on outcomes

### Why This Matters

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift from:
- **Prompt ‚Üí Response** (traditional LLMs)
